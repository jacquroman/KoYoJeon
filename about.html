<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>It’s the time for the annual KoYonJeon – <b>Korea university vs. Yonsei university rivalry games</b>. The red Korea University’s tigers face blue Yonsei’s eagles in the two-day games, challenging each other in baseball, hockey, basketball, rugby and soccer. Through the games, the excited audience is there, cheering on top of their lungs, and that doesn’t mean just screaming and clapping. We’re talking about coordinated, rehearsed dances and songs, led by the cheering squad in their amazing colourful costumes drawing from traditional Korean outfits.</p>
